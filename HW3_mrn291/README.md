# Homework Assignment 3 for PUI2018 Evening Session

#### Part One
I did part one of this assignment (deleting data from a repository) independently.

#### Part Two
I did part two of this assignment (reading in data from Open Data) independently, consulting the following resources:

 - [This Stack Overflow Article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27472548/pandas-scatter-plotting-datetime)
 - [NYC's Open Data Site](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/)
 - [Dr. Bianco's Example Notebook](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/blob/master/HW3_fb55/Assignment2_example.ipynb)

#### Part Three
I worked on part three of this assignment with [Christine Biddlecombe](mailto:cb4421@nyu.edu) and she showed me how to use the system argument to submit the key and the bus line via the command line.

I also consulted Dr. Bianco's [weather example script](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/blob/master/Lab3_fb55/APIreadingJson.ipynb) to see how to use urllib and Dr. Bianco's [simple script example](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/blob/master/Lab3_fb55/aSimplePythonScript.py) for how to check the system argument length.
