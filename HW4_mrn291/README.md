# Homework Assignment 4 for PUI2018 Evening Session

#### Part One
For part one, we were asked to take 100 samples of varying sizes (N > 10 and N < 2000) from five different distributions, then plot the sample means against the size of the sample as well as plot all of the means together in one histogram.

I compared notes on this assignment with Christine Biddlecombe and Nathan Caplan. Nathan found a helpful article about fitting a gaussian curve to a histogram, and Christine and I went over the instructions for the assignment to make sure we were both understanding the requirements.  I also consulted the Numpy documentation and Dr. Bianco's [example notebook.](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/blob/master/HW4_fb55/Assignment1.ipynb)


#### Part Two
For part two, we were asked to formulate an idea and a null and alternative hypothesis based on Citibike data.  We were then asked to read in the Citibike data and do some basic manipulation of the resulting dataframe to plot the variables used in our null/alternative hypotheses.

I worked on this part of the assignment independently, consulting the Pandas documentation, the Curl documentation, and the Matplotlib documentation, and also used Dr. Bianco's [example notebook.](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/blob/master/HW4_fb55/citibikes_gender.ipynb)

To successfully run this notebook, you need to have an environmental variable named PUIDATA that references a local directory on your machine to which the data will be downloaded.

#### Part Three
For part three, we were asked to calculate the Z score in order to evaluate if a new bus route lowers commute times on average compared to the old bus route.

I worked on the coding part of the assignment independently. Christine and Nathan and I reviewed the concept of the Z score and reviewed the reading together.
